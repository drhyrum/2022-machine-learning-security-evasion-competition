A valid antiphishing evasion submission consists of the following:
1. a ZIP file containing modified malware samples with their original names (`001`, `002`, etc.)
2. when rendered in a Chromium-based browser like [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge?r=1), each sample renders identically to the original
3. partial uploads are okay, and can be used to "update" or "complete" a solution
4. uploads are rate limited; only infrequent uploads are allowed
